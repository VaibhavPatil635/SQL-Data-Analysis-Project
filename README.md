📊 SQL Business Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL-based analytical scripts focused on extracting business insights from structured data.
The analysis follows a logical analytics workflow including data understanding, customer reporting, segmentation, cumulative metrics, and change-over-time trends.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL compatible)

Relational Databases

Business-oriented analytical queries

📂 Project Files & Purpose
1️⃣ data types.sql

Validates and explores data types of different columns

Ensures data consistency before performing analysis

Helps identify issues related to dates, numbers, and text fields

2️⃣ build customer report.sql

Generates customer-level reports

Analyzes customer activity and performance using aggregations

Useful for understanding customer behavior and key metrics

3️⃣ change over time trands.sql

Performs change-over-time trend analysis

Tracks business performance across time periods (monthly / yearly)

Helps identify growth, decline, and seasonal patterns

4️⃣ cumulative analysis.sql

Calculates cumulative metrics such as running totals

Uses window functions to analyze progressive business performance

Useful for long-term trend evaluation

5️⃣ data segmetation.sql

Segments data based on business rules and conditions

Helps compare different customer or product groups

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL-driven data analysis by answering real business-style questions such as:

How performance changes over time

Which customers or segments contribute the most

How cumulative metrics evolve

How data can be structured for reporting and insights

🚀 Outcome

This project highlights my ability to:

Perform end-to-end analysis using SQL

Think in terms of business questions, not just queries

Write clean, readable, and reusable SQL scripts for analytics
